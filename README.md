# Flutter DOM Manipulation

This project showcases how to manipulate DOM in Flutter Web using JavaScript interop.

The repository contains code in fulfillment of a technical task provided by IT Solutions Management International Pte. Ltd.

## Supported Platforms
- Web

## Task Requirements
Using the provided template in 'DartPad' (https://dartpad.dev?id=0b02135dbf65e53aaa64dfe513d0bc85), please complete the following steps:

1. URL Input Field and Image Display:
   Create an input field for a URL and a button. When the button is clicked, an image should appear in the center of the application using an HTML `< img >` element (not a Flutter `Image` widget).
- Double-clicking on the image should toggle the browser's fullscreen mode. Use JS functions called directly from Dart for this functionality.

2. "Plus" Button and Context Menu:
   Add a button with a "Plus" icon to the bottom-right corner of the screen.
- Clicking on this button should display a context menu with "Enter fullscreen" and "Exit fullscreen" buttons above it.
- When the menu is open, the background should dim while the button and menu remain highlighted.
- Clicking outside the menu should close it, and clicking the menu buttons should perform the corresponding action and close the menu.

3. Final Result:
- Submit your code as a link to a GitHub repository.
- Deploy the compiled web version of the application on GitHub Pages.
- Ensure the code is formatted and documented according to the guidelines in 'Effective Dart' (https://dart.dev/effective-dart/documentation).
